      <description>Week 26+27 (June 28th - July 9th) #  Summer is here and vacations with it. Most of the work done in this sprint is either internal (not user facing) or not finished yet.
 Thanks to MaťejM Packit Service now triggers a new Copr build if no suitable build has been found. That fixes an issue that the service sometimes did not react to /packit test. (packit-service#1132)  </description>

      <description>Week 22 (May 31st - June 4th) #   We have a new status page, kudos to Jirka! Franta fixed a bug that if some action during propose-downstream caused an upstream git repository to be dirty, the sync for other branches failed. (packit-service#1111) packit generate is not supported anymore. (packit#1269) Tomáš improved the patch ordering. (packit#1263)  Week 23 (June 7th - June 11th) #   Tomáš improved the way changelog is passed from source-git repo to dist-git.</description>

      <description>Week 18 (May 3rd - May 7th) #   Laura fixed the problem with fedora-latest alias (packit#1222). We now have separate workers for short and long running tasks. This should lead to better responsiveness (packit-service#1059, deployment#202).  Week 19 (May 10th - May 14th) #   Jirka added support for creating Bugzilla bugs for newly created MRs on GitLab (packit-service#1087). The installation instructions for failed or unfinished COPR builds are not displayed on the results page (dashboard#104).</description>

      <description>Week 14 (April 4th - April 9th) #   Honza converted packit&amp;rsquo;s test suite from STI to FMF and configured packit to synchronize the suite to Fedora dist-git (packit#1192). Franta fixed a bug in packit which kept only appending targets to an existing COPR project which is no longer a case - dropped targets are now being removed (packit#1197).  Week 15 (April 12th - April 16th) #   Tomáš fixed an issue in chaining variable definitions in the RPM macros used to set up source-git repositories with packit init (packit#1206).</description>

      <description>March 2021 #  Week 9 (March 1st - March 5th) #   Tomas improved the performance of sandcastle, all the user-defined actions now run in one sandbox. This should also speed up the SRPM builds. (packit#1129) You can view the results of jobs directly in our dashboard, kudos to Anchit. (dashboard#73) Jirka implemented setting of the environment context when running the Testing farm tests. (packit-service#1008) In Packit there is a new configuration option sources which overrides the URLs defined in specfiles.</description>

      <description>February 2021 #  Week 5 (February 1st - February 5th) #   The service uses new Testing Farm (API). We are still working on better user experience and fixing bugs. (packit-service#875) MatejF refactored permission system on pull requests and issues comments and renamed whitelist to allowlist. (packit-service#936) The service now retries failed tasks. (packit-service#931) --koji-target option of the CLI&amp;rsquo;s build command now accepts aliases. (packit#1052) The service runs on Fedora 33 now.</description>

      <description>January 2021 #  Week 1 (January 4th - January 8th) #   Name of the job/command/comment to propose update of downstream package has been synced between CLI and service to propose-downstream. propose-update is now deprecated. (packit#1065, packit-service#913)  Week 2 (January 11th - January 15th) #   Branch deletions are now correctly ignored. (packit-service#919) Multiple internal improvements have been done. (packit#1072, packit-service#922, packit-service#923)  Week 3 (January 18th - January 22th) #   We have temporarily disabled the testing-farm support because the cluster with old runner has died and the new runner is not ready.</description>

      <description>Week 49 (November 30th - December 4th) #   Jano fixed a bug in sync_release method of Packit API. (packit#1043) Jiri Konecny contributed a fix for how Packit creates COPR urls. (packit#1039) Laura updated instructions how to retrigger a job. (packit-service#892)  Week 50 (December 7th - December 11th) #   Tomas implemented the --upstream-url option of packit init command. When specified, init also sets up a source-git repository next to creating a configuration file.</description>

      <description>Week 45 (November 2nd - November 6th) #   Laura implemented an option for packit to copy description from a release into a changelog when running propose-update. Also the default message has been changed to the list of commit messages from last release. (packit#1004) Jano improved handling of build targets in packit. (packit#986) Tomas improved an experience of a contributor to source-git in case the contributor doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow git-am patches style that is used.</description>

      <description>Week 41 (October 5th - October 9th) #   franta made triggering of jobs more reliable and in correct situations (packit-service#837)  Week 42 (October 12th - October 16th) #  Nothing significant happened during this week. The only change was that Hunor resolved a problem when sentry client library (the alert service we use) caused errors in stage environment and hence the problem didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to production.</description>

      <title>Working on the next major RHEL release, in your upstream repo</title>
      <link>https://packit.dev/posts/fedora-eln/</link>

      <description>Fedora EL Niño (ELN) is such an awesome idea. It enables building rawhide packages in two distinct buildroots:
 the standard Fedora Rawhide buildroot and a second one, which mimics Red Hat Enterprise Linux  This way you can make sure that your new upstream release builds fine in the next RHEL.
But this feedback might be a little bit too late: the upstream release already happened and the code was imported in Fedora dist-git, so fixing an issue will require repeating the whole process.</description>

      <description>Week 36 (August 31th - September 4th) #   We store the submission time of SRPM builds now (packit-service#795 by Anchit). Shreyas improved implementation of the build status reporting (packit-service#740). Anchit enhanced the /koji-builds endpoint to be more consistent with /copr-builds endpoint (packit-service#791).  Week 37 (September 7th - September 11th) #   Stage now uses Tokman to get access tokens for GitHub, which should resolve race condition when running parallel jobs (Tokman by Hunor, ogr integration by Matej).</description>

      <description>Week 32 (August 3rd - August 7th) and 33 (August 10th - August 13th) #   We renamed our GitHub organisation to packit. That user had been inactive for a long time and Hunor&amp;rsquo;s request was successful. The Copr project settings are now changed only if needed. If we can&amp;rsquo;t edit the settings, we ask for the admin access to the Copr project and the service shows you a table with the changes if you want to do the edit manually.</description>

      <description>Week 27 (June 29th - July 3rd) #  packit #   We introduced a new command packit validate-config which validates the contect of a package configuration file in your project (contributed by @TomasJani, #826).  packit-as-a-service #   You are now able to override configuration for builds, releases and other jobs (by @TomasTomecek, #676). Read more about this feature here.  Week 28 (July 6th - July 10th) #  packit #   Command validate-config works properly now and does not produce odd error messages, by @TomasTomecek and @csomh, #894 and #895 You will now properly see git-describe metadata in the %release field in spec file when using srpm command, by @TomasTomecek, #894 git-log is being used to get a list of commits between HEAD and latest tag to pick up commit messages and add those to %changelog, by @TomasTomecek, #889 packit is now able to load metadata from commits of a source-git repo and utilize them when creating patch files, by @lachmanfrantisek, #875  packit-as-a-service #   We now have a new API endpoint: /api/projects/, by @IceWreck, #716 Over the last few weeks, @lbarcziova was very busy with refactoring how jobs and tasks are being executed in packit-service.</description>

      <description>Week 23 (June 1st - June 5th) #  Hello everyone, during this week we didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to implement any significant new features - most of the work happened under the hood.
packit #   We have fixed a formatting issue when packit prints installation instructions for using builds from a copr repo (by @lachmanfrantisek, #852). You are able to set up builds when you push to a branch, we have set this up for master branch of packit, feel free to get inspired (by @lachmanfrantisek, #851).</description>

      <description>Week 19 (May 4th - May 6th) #  packit #   The image now uses ogr from git master instead of from Fedora stable RPM.  packit-service #   Franta Fixed a previous week introduced bug, which prevented users from being whitelisted. (#599) Hunor Made improvements to avoid a race condition in getting app access token. (#601)  Week 20+21 (May 11th - May 22th) #  packit #   The debug logs in the CLI are now much more consistent.</description>

      <description>Week 14 (March 30th - April 3rd) #  packit #   Fix web URLs for Copr builds owned by groups (#778). Create downstream spec if it&amp;rsquo;s not there (propose-update) - this used to happen when using packit on a newly created package in Fedora which did not have spec fille added yet. (#779) Packit no longer inspects archive extension set in Source and creates .tar.gz by default - this should be more flexible and prevent issues for &amp;ldquo;non-standard&amp;rdquo; archive names.</description>

      <description>Week 10 (March 2nd - March 6th) #  packit #   The generate command is now deprecated in favour of the init command (#728), contributed by @shreyaspapi.  packit-service #   When a non-collaborator creates a PR, packit says that only &amp;ldquo;Collaborators can trigger packit-service&amp;rdquo; - this message has been improved to better match the reality (#445). Packit service no longer posts comments on pull requests when a SRPM can&amp;rsquo;t be created - the logs should be now aviable in the service&amp;rsquo;s logs view available when clocking on the commit status check URL (#447).</description>

      <description>Week 6 #  Both Packit and Packit Service pre-commit hooks were updated to include prettier and setup-cfg-fmt, in order to have a more consistent formatting of markup, YAML, JSON and setup.cfg files.
It became easier for developers to build the Packit base image locally, and tests in Zuul were configured to run on Fedora 31.
Packit learned how to look for RPM spec files on its own, so specifying specfile_path in the configuration is not mandatory anymore.</description>

(#303, #304) Correctly checks list of whitelisted repositories when issue comment is added. (#309)  Week 2 #  packit #   Incorporates lots of SRPM related improvements. (#646, #650, #651, #652, #653) Better handles when Copr owner is not set.</description>
